# MDStudio_examples

This repository hosts a series of examples to illustrate the development
and use of microservices for the MDStudio environment.

The repository is organized in two parts each with their own README.md
files explaining both general concepts and in-depth cases:

- building_microservices: all about building new microservices to add
  functional endpoints to the MDStudio environment.
- using_microservices: the microservice endpoints available within an
  MDStudio environment can be used in multiple ways; from a script, the
  command line or in a dedicated workflow environment for instance.
  This directory provides examples for these.
